    "description": "Class-of-service (CoS) network traffic classification (NTC) classifies a group of similar traffic applications. The CoS classification is advantageous in resource scheduling for Internet service providers and avoids the necessity of remodelling. Our goal is to find a robust, lightweight, and fast-converging CoS classifier that uses fewer data in modelling and does not require specialized tools in feature extraction. The commonality of statistical features among the network flow segments motivates us to propose novel segmented learning that includes essential vector representation and a simple-segment method of classification. We represent the segmented traffic in the vector form using the EVR. Then, the segmented traffic is modelled for classification using random forest. Our solution's success relies on finding the optimal segment size and a minimum number of segments required in modelling. The solution is validated on multiple datasets for various CoS services, including virtual reality (VR). Significant fi",

We commence by highlighting the compelling use cases empowered by the IoS and also the key network requirements. We then elaborate on how the emerging semantic communications and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) paradigms along with 6G technologies may satisfy the requirements of IoS use cases. On one hand, semantic communications can be applied for extracting meaningful and significant information and, hence efficiently exploit the resources and for harnessing former information at the receiver to satisfy IoS requirements. On the other hand, AI/ML facilitates frugal network resource management by making use of the enormous amount of data generated in IoS edge nodes and devices, as well as by optimizing the IoS performance via intelligent agents. However, the intelligent agents deployed at the edge are",
