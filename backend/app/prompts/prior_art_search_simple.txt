Generate a comprehensive prior art search report for: {user_query}

**Patents Found**: {document_reference}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: This report MUST analyze ALL patents found, not just the first 3. Do NOT limit detailed analysis to 3 patents. Analyze every single patent with detailed claim-by-claim analysis.**

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT: You are REQUIRED to analyze ALL patents found. If you only analyze 3 patents, this report will be INVALID and must be regenerated. Count the patents and ensure you analyze EVERY SINGLE ONE.**
