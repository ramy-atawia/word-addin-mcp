DOCUMENT PARAGRAPHS:
{paragraphs}

Your task:
1. Analyze each paragraph in context of its position in the document
2. Identify specific text within paragraphs that needs changing
3. Generate precise change instructions with exact text matching
4. Consider document flow and structure
5. Provide clear reasoning for each change

Return modifications as JSON with this exact format:
{{
    "modifications": [
        {{
            "paragraph_index": 0,
            "changes": [
                {{
                    "action": "replace" or "insert" or "delete",
                    "exact_find_text": "exact text as it appears in document",
                    "replace_text": "replacement text",
                    "reason": "why this change is needed"
                }}
            ]
        }}
    ],
    "summary": "Brief summary of all modifications made"
}}

Be specific about what content to change, add, remove, or reorganize.
Consider the impact on document flow and reader experience.
Ensure all changes are actionable and clearly defined.
Use exact text matching - the exact_find_text must match exactly what appears in the document.
