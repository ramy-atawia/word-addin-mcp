## Patentability Assessment

### Novelty Analysis (35 USC 102)
- **Anticipation Risk**: Direct disclosure in single prior art reference
- **Novel Elements**: Features not found in prior art
- **Disclosure Gaps**: Missing elements in closest prior art

### Non-Obviousness Analysis (35 USC 103)
- **Closest Prior Art**: Most similar reference
- **Differences**: What distinguishes invention from closest art
- **Secondary Considerations**: Commercial success, long-felt need, etc.
- **Obviousness Risk**: Likelihood of obviousness rejection

### Subject Matter Eligibility (35 USC 101)
- **Abstract Idea**: Whether invention claims abstract concepts
- **Inventive Concept**: Technical improvement analysis
- **Eligibility Risk**: Alice/Mayo framework assessment
