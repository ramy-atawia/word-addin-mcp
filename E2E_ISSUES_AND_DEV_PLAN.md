# E2E Testing Issues Analysis & Development Plan

## üìä Test Results Summary
- **Total Queries Tested:** 34
- **Successful Queries:** 25 (73.5% success rate)
- **Tool Workflows Executed:** 15
- **Conversations Handled:** 10

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Intent Detection Problems**
**Issue:** Several query types are incorrectly classified as `conversation` instead of `tool_workflow`

**Affected Queries:**
- `"draft 1 system claim"` ‚Üí Should be `tool_workflow` but treated as `conversation`
- `"prior art search artificial intelligence"` ‚Üí Should be `tool_workflow` but times out
- `"web search 5G AI and draft system claims"` ‚Üí Should be `tool_workflow` but treated as `conversation`

**Root Cause:** The LLM intent detection prompt is not properly recognizing these patterns as tool workflows.

### 2. **Conversation History Propagation Failure**
**Issue:** Context from previous queries is not being passed to subsequent queries

**Example:**
```
Query 1: "web search Ramy Atawia" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Tool workflow (web search)
Query 2: "draft 1 system claim" ‚Üí ‚ùå Conversation (should use Ramy Atawia context)
```

**Root Cause:** The conversation history-based workflow detection is not working properly.

### 3. **Timeout Issues**
**Issue:** Several queries are timing out after 60 seconds

**Affected Queries:**
- `"web search blockchain patents"`
- `"prior art search artificial intelligence"`
- `"draft 1 system claim"`
- `"prior art search machine learning"`

**Root Cause:** Complex queries or tool execution taking too long.

### 4. **Workflow Response Generation Failure**
**Issue:** Some tool workflows execute but fail to generate proper responses

**Example:**
```
Query: "analyze the findings"
Response: "Failed to generate response: No workflow results or errors to generate response from"
```

**Root Cause:** The workflow response generation logic has issues with context passing.

### 5. **Multi-step Query Handling**
**Issue:** Complex multi-step queries are treated as conversation instead of tool workflows

**Examples:**
- `"web search 5G AI and draft system claims"` ‚Üí Conversation
- `"web search blockchain, analyze patents, and draft claims"` ‚Üí Conversation

**Root Cause:** The intent detection doesn't recognize complex multi-step patterns.
